You'll need to buy a Kirby License if you want to use it on a live website. It's worth it :)\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nThis theme was built for Kirby 2.3+. It is based on the Strongly Typed theme by <http://html5up.com> and was adapted for Kirby. \r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\nWell everything you see is customizable... of course.\r\n- The nav and header\r\n- The 3 column layout called \"services\" can be changed from 2 to 4\r\n- The banner section includes an image selector, text color picker, and the text field.\r\n- The latest blog posts are displayed on the homepage. But you can change the order!\r\n- The number of posts displayed in the blog page is customizable.\r\n- Smart pagination is included\r\n- Each blog post has its own page with optional cover image.\r\n- A post can be published \"in the future\" with a custom Published Date feature.\r\n- The sidebar is optional and can be displayed on either side. \r\n- Customize the number of posts in the sidebar. It's a smart sidebar that won't ever include the posts that are already visible in the main section.\r\n- The contact form is optional\r\n- It's powered by <http://formspree.io> and has built-in AJAX.\r\n- It's fully customizable. You can even change your email address from the panel!\r\n- The information details are also optional. Add as many contact information or social links straight from the panel.\r\n- The footer is obviously also customizable!\r\n\r\n## Pages included:\r\n- Homepage\r\n- Blog Page\r\n- Article Page\r\n- Error Page\r\n- Blank Page\r\n\r\nTo view a live demo of the website, see here: <http://hiweb.fr/typed>\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n1.
