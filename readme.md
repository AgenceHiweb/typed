# TYPED. Kirby Theme

Live demo at <http://hiweb.fr/typed>
TYPED. is a blog theme for Kirby CMS. You may want to read more about Kirby on the <http://getkirby.com> website. You'll need to buy a Kirby License if you want to use it on a live website. It's worth it :)

## Introduction
This theme was built for Kirby 2.3+. It is based on the Strongly Typed theme by <http://html5up.com> and was adapted for Kirby. 

## How does it work?
Well everything you see is customizable... of course.
- The nav and header
- The 3 column layout called "services" can be changed from 2 to 4
- The banner section includes an image selector, text color picker, and the text field.
- The latest blog posts are displayed on the homepage. But you can change the order!
- The number of posts displayed in the blog page is customizable.
- Smart pagination is included
- Each blog post has its own page with optional cover image.
- A post can be published "in the future" with a custom Published Date feature.
- The sidebar is optional and can be displayed on either side. 
- Customize the number of posts in the sidebar. It's a smart sidebar that won't ever include the posts that are already visible in the main section.
- The contact form is optional
- It's powered by <http://formspree.io> and has built-in AJAX.
- It's fully customizable. You can even change your email address from the panel!
- The information details are also optional. Add as many contact information or social links straight from the panel.
- The footer is obviously also customizable!

Pages included:
- Homepage
- Blog Page
- Article Page
- Error Page
- Blank Page
