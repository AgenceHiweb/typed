# Terms and License
You should carefully read the following Terms and Conditions. Your purchase or use of our themes implies that you have read and accepted these Terms and Conditions.

## Theme License
Our Kirby themes themselves are licensed under the GNU General Public License.
You may use your purchased themes on as many websites as you like.

All Bundled plugins are open-source and can be used on multiple domains.
For more details please refer to the themes humans.txt file for details about plugins packaged with each theme.

## Update and Compatibility
All Kirby themes sold by Hiweb are always tested and updated to be compatible with the latest stable version of Kirby. However, Hiweb can give no guarantee that current versions of our themes will be compatible with previous versions of Kirby, or that previous versions of our themes will be compatible with the current version of Kirby.

## Theme Support
Technical Support is provided via email or direct message. This is the quickest and most efficient way for our customers to receive support.
We do not provide general Kirby support that isn’t related to our themes. You’ll need to ask for help with general Kirby questions here: <http://forum.getkirby.com>
We are happy to see you modify our themes to fit your needs and we are happy to help, but there is a limit to what we can do. In General if your modification needs more than a couple lines of new code, we will need to discuss for a proper customization contract.
We’re not able to support third party plugins or ensure that every one works properly with our themes.

## Warranty
We only guarantee that the themes will function on a clean install of Kirby as advertised. We are not responsible to make the theme function with plugins you currently use or will use in future.

## Refund Policy
We offer refunds to any unsatisfied customer up to 15 days after the purchase was made. If you would like your money back, simply send us an email.

## Privacy Policy
Customer information is collected for the purpose of processing your order. This information is kept confidential and is not shared.
